Description
Imagine you have a special keyboard with the following keys:

Key 1: (A): Print one 'A' on screen.

Key 2: (Ctrl-A): Select the whole screen.

Key 3: (Ctrl-C): Copy selection to buffer.

Key 4: (Ctrl-V): Print buffer on screen appending it after what has already been printed.

Now, you can only press the keyboard for N times (with the above four keys), find out the maximum numbers of 'A' you can print on screen.

public class Solution {
    /**
     * @param N: an integer
     * @return: return an integer
     */
    public int maxA(int N) {
        // write your code here
        if(N < 5) return N;
        
        int dp[] = new int[N+1];
        
        for(int i = 0; i <=N; i++){
            dp[i] = i;
            for( int j = 0; j <=(i-3); j++){
                dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i], dp[j] *(i-j-1));
            }
            
        }
        
        return dp[N];
    }
}
