trick and importance:
#1 for left,right pointer, remember to left++ and right--
#2 speel check, focus on ; ) return. make sure no : in the end
#3 make sure check above #2 when writing everyline codes
#4 to calculate distance with sum, add map.put(0, -1) to make it easier
#5 the spell of length
#6 remember to consider the carray when adding to listnodes
#7 add ; to the comparator
mistakes and importance:

#186 Reverse Words in a String II
forgot to shift left++ and right--
remember to handle the edge case(i.e in the end)


#325Maximum Size Subarray Sum Equals k
added map.put(0, -1) to make it easy to calculate distance(i - pos)
try to finish everything in one loop

#Compare Version Numbers
make sure fill the missing length with 0

#Longest Palindromic Substring
Forgot to right else case
if(s.charAt(left) == s.charAt(right)){}else{return;}

#238. Product of Array Except Self
  using    int leftSides = 1, int rightSides = 1;

#287. Find the Duplicate Number
remember to use count to check with the mid value; if count > mid, then move high to mid

# Add Two Numbers
forgot to add the carry
need to add () around the conditional operator ?:

#160. Intersection of Two Linked Lists
forgot to move the point when calculate the list len
forgot to handle the edge case

# Merge k Sorted Lists
for using priorityQueue:
  forgot the check the null node
for Divide and conquer using two way merge:
 code could more precise. using while(right >0)

#98. Validate Binary Search Tree
3 solutions, top to bottom valid, in order search with recursion and iteration
for the iteration solution, could use   curr = curr.right;
instead of below,
    if(curr.right != null){
        curr = curr.right;
    }else{
        curr = null;
    }
